# Connect Four Game

This is a two-player Connect Four game implemented using Python and Pygame. One player is controlled by the user (Player 1), while the other player (Player 2) is controlled by the AI using a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making.

## Features:
- Player 1 (Human) uses the mouse to place pieces in the grid.
- Player 2 (AI) makes moves based on the Minimax algorithm.
- The game board is a 6x7 grid.
- The game continues until one player wins or the grid is full.

## Game Mechanics:
The game is played on a 6-row by 7-column grid. The players take turns dropping their pieces into the columns. The first player to align 4 pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. The AI player uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate possible moves and make decisions based on the current state of the game.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame Library

## How to Run the Game:
To play the game, ensure you have Python 3 and Pygame installed. Follow the steps below:
