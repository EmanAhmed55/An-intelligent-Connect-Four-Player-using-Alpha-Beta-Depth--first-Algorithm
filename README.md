    <h1>Connect 4 Game in Python with Pygame</h1>
    <p>This is a simple Connect 4 game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game features both player vs. player and player vs. AI modes. The AI uses a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine the best moves.</p>
    
    <h2>Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI</li>
        <li>AI powered by Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning</li>
        <li>Real-time game board update with Pygame</li>
        <li>Simple and user-friendly graphical interface</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Run the Game:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. If not, you can install them with:</li>
        <pre><code>pip install pygame</code></pre>
        <li>Download or clone the repository:</li>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect4-pygame.git</code></pre>
        <li>Navigate to the game directory:</li>
        <pre><code>cd connect4-pygame</code></pre>
        <li>Run the game using Python:</li>
        <pre><code>python connect4.py</code></pre>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>The game board consists of a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns. Players take turns dropping colored discs into columns. The first player to connect four of their discs either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If the board is full and no player has won, itâ€™s a draw.</p>
